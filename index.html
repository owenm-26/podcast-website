            <h2>Episode Name | Money vs Morals</h2>
            <h4>By: Owen Mariani, Everett Banholzer, Ryan Hwang</h4>
            <p class = "description">Welcome to money vs morals, where three friends, Everett, Owen, and Ryan, discuss what drives humanity in certain situations, money or morals. If you have never realized, humanity can be out for itself occasionally. Ad agencies only care about the money they generate rather than the image they produce. Authors writing to translate lessons and entertainment rather than trying to get book sales. It’s impossible to truly know the intentions of others but it’s always important to question our society. Rather than letting the world pass by without truly understanding it, always question, question everything. Asking questions is what leads to success. This is precisely why we have started this podcast, to question society in a way that reveals why we do our daily actions.
